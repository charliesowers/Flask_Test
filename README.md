# Flask_Test

Clone repo. navigate into Flask_Rendezvous_Test in terminal and execute: py run.py (or whatever command you have locally to execute python programs. same as you used for
HW1). Assuming you have flask installed from HW1 it should now be running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ . Go there in your browser, and see if the dropdown menu works. The main programs to look at and play around with are \flaskapp\templates\index.html, \flaskapp\routes.py, and wrangling_scripts\wrangling.py.

The character names that pop up each time you select a new character are coming from the movies API which is being called in python each time you change the dropdown and then served back to d3 as a json file and then appended.
